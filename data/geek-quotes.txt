The first necessity is for the software designer and his customers to recognize that there is a conflict of objectives, and that there is the need for compromise. Secondly, it is essential that the compromise be selected in the light of a sound knowledge of good algorithms and program structures, and not merely as a result of wishful thinking of a sales or product specification department.

As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program; debugging sessions are transient.
